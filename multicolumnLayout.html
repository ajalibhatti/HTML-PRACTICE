<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

<h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
<p>
When designing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, 
we spend a lot of time focusing on aspects such as the nature of learning algorithms 
i.e. supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or the characteristics of the data 
i.e. classified, unclassified. However, little attention is often provided to the 
nature of the environment on which the AI solution operates. As it turns out, 
the characteristics of the environment are one of the absolutely key elements 
to determine the right models for an AI solution.
